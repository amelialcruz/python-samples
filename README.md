## About

As of August 2022 I am working towards filling out my personal GitHub with sample work to accumulate a decent portfolio. Please feel free to view some sample python works here. There is not necessairly a rhyme or rhythm to these, I simply do random small tasks/projects to keep in touch with Python but to also strengthen my knowledge.
